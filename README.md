## Yvonne Tang 

I recently returned to London after spending eight years in China. A country where customers are told that they need to pay ‘exact change’ if they are to pay by cash otherwise the ‘sensible’ decision would be to use either WeChat pay or Alipay, two of China’s biggest payment apps. It is the experiences in China that defines my passion in tech and the desire to become a junior software engineer. It is also why I’ve enrolled in Makers Academy’s 16-week coding bootcamp. 

A fluent speaker in both English and Mandarin, I have a particular interest in the Fintech sector and would love to work for an energetic start-up company. 

## Skills

#### Communication/

As a PR executive at both Cohn & Wolfe, Hill & Knowlton and later a freelancer at MviewPR. My role was to communicate the client's key messages to both the International and the Chinese media, as well as communicating effectively with both chinese colleagues and international collagues either through English or Mandarin. This resulted in successfully organising press events; Rolls-Royce Motor Car’s Beijing Auto Show is one example of a press event where I facilitated in reaching out to the Chinese and International Media. 

As a result of my ability to speak both English and Mandarin this enabled me to create a greater contact pool and receive my own clients which eventually led to me working as a freelancer for MviewPR, a PR start-up company where I translated press materials from Chinese to English, as well developing campaigns for leading international healthcare companies such as Lilly, raising awareness on various health issues in China, this included, diabetes, sexual health.
