## Yvonne Tang 

I'm currently training to become a junior software developer at Makers Academy, a 16-week intensive coding bootcamp. A fluent speaker in both English and Mandarin, I bring with me a bicultural perspective, providing a deep and informed understanding of cross-cultural relations between China and the UK. I have particular in interest in Fintech. 

Prior,to Makers I spent eight years in China, working in the education and PR sectors. Whilst there, I became fascinated and in awe in the explosion of new technology. Taobao, WeChat and Alipay are to name a few of the products that became a daily fixature in my life. I was also curious as to how these products were developed and how they seamlessly transformed a society's attitude and behaviour within a few years. An example would be the shift from a ‘cash-only’ to a ‘mobile-only-payment’ society. 

## Skills

#### Communication

As a PR executive at both Cohn & Wolfe, Hill & Knowlton and later a freelancer at MviewPR. My role was to communicate the client's key messages to both the International and the Chinese media, as well as communicating effectively with both chinese colleagues and international collagues either through English or Mandarin. This resulted in successfully organising press events, Rolls-Royce Motor Car’s Beijing Auto Show is example of a press event where I helped to reached out to the Chinese and International media on the launch of their latest models in China. In addition, I was able to develop and maintain solid relationship with Chinese and International media.
