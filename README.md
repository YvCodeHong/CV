## Yvonne Tang 

A bi-linguist in English and Mandarin, I’ve spent the past eight years in China, working in the education and PR sectors. Whilst there, I became fascinated and in awe in the explosion of new technology. Taobao, WeChat and Alipay are to name a few of the products that became a daily fixature in my life. I was also curious as to how these products were developed and how they seamlessly transformed a society's attitude and behaviour within a few years. An example would be the shift from a ‘cash-only’ to a ‘mobile-only-payment’ society. 

I’m currently enrolled at Makers Academy, a 16-week intensive development bootcamp, training to become a junior software developer. I’m seeking to join a company with a mission to make change.

In my final year disseration, I looked into whether the introduction of digital cameras was solely the reason behind our   change in attitudes towards the circulation of photography to the extent it has created social changes or if it was the combined inception of digital cameras and Web 2.0. My disseration and a module in New Media Technology was the start in my curiosity towards the technological world and the effect it has on our lives.
