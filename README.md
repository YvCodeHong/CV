## Yvonne Tang 

A bi-linguist in English and Mandarin, I am currently undertaking a 12-week intensive coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. Prior to this, I spent eight years in China where I first studied the language and then worked in the education and PR field. My curiosity towards tech largely stems from experiencing first-hand the explosion of China’s tech industry. Products such as WeChat, Taobao and Alipay left me in awe. I was fixated at how a product can be created in a way that changes the way we interact, and more importantly solve problems. I am fascinated in the e-commerce and e-payments sector, the latter being the area that I’m most interested in and would love to pursue after my 12 weeks of coding.

In my final year disseration, I looked into whether the introduction of digital cameras was solely the reason behind our   change in attitudes towards the circulation of photography to the extent it has created social changes or if it was the combined inception of digital cameras and Web 2.0. My disseration and a module in New Media Technology was the start in my curiosity towards the technological world and the effect it has on our lives.
